## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, a second year undergraduate student at Cornell University. I am studying Mechanical Engineering and I am a part of the Cornell Baja racing team, specifically the brakes subteam. 

I am interested in mechanical design and manufacturing. My most recent work was designing fully custom master cylinders for our single-seat off road racing car.
